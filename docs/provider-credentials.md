# Provider credentials

What each provider module needs from its credential. Mint keys with exactly these permissions. A key missing one fails in ways that are hard to read: Daytona's list returns nothing instead of an error.

## Daytona (`daytona`, Rust host)

Credential: an API key, as a plain token file. Configuration also needs `organization_id` and `ssh_host_key`.

Create it on the Daytona website (Dashboard → API Keys → Restricted); the CLI can't create keys. Read on sandboxes, snapshots, registries and regions is always granted.

| Permission | Used for |
|---|---|
| Sandboxes: Write, Delete | create, start, stop, exec, delete |
| Snapshots: Write, Delete | create and activate (prepare) |
| Limits: Read | `GET /organizations/{id}/usage` (quota) |
| Billing: Read | the analytics usage aggregate (usage) |

Leave the rest off.

Known problem (2026-10-30): `GET /sandbox` returned an empty list for our key while sandboxes were live, so drydock couldn't see the sandboxes it made, including leaked ones. Read on sandboxes is always granted, so the key's permissions aren't the cause; it is not yet understood. Fetching one sandbox by ID or name works.

## Namespace (`namespace`, TypeScript host)

Credential: a revocable token as JSON, `{"bearer_token": …}`. The same token is the `nscr.io` push password (user `token`).

Create it with `nsc token create` and explicit grants. Revocable tokens refuse wildcards on `instance`, so list its actions.

```
devbox *            devbox/image *
instance create, dial_host, ssh, exec, get, list, refresh, wait
ingress access
containerregistry *  containerregistry/repository *  containerregistry/image *
```

- Without `ingress access`, every SDK gateway call returns 403.
- Quota (`UsageService/GetConcurrency`) needs a grant beyond these, not yet identified. Without it quota is refused and the provider stays ready.
- Image optimize is refused for every grant a revocable token can carry; the module doesn't call it.
